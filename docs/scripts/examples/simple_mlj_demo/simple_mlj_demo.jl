# we can also accelerate learning by using parallelism
# notice how above we had 20 metamodels followed by sequences of 1?
# What is happening here is that there is an initial stage (by default 20)
# of models drawn entirely at random (using specified prior distributions)
# without probabilistic modelling. Once probabilistic modelling kicks in,
# we draw a suggestion and then update with result. This doesn't seem amenable
# to parallelism, and it isn't. However there is an additional parameter
# `max_simultaneous_draws` which allows the system to draw `n` samples before
# `updating the distribution. Whilst intuitively this allows parallelism, it
# also enables more exploration before drawing again according to updated distribution.
# If using this parameter, consider increasing the value of `linear_forgetting`
# from its default of 25 to a higher number -- a good place is probably at least `n*25`. The
# `linear_forgetting` parameter keeps most n recently observed results equally weighted
# and older observations are  weighted by a linear ramp according to their age.

# grab previous best result again, hey we started cheating, might as well continue.

# An interesting feature of note is that TreeParzen supports "tree-structured"
# parameter spaces; hence the name. Originally conceived for optimising
# Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), where parameters take form such as number of layers,
# and how many nodes are within each layer. Here, we can see the idea that if
# we have 2 layers, then number of nodes in layer 3 as a parameter is not relevant.
# We can construct a similar example using XGBoost - either we can use boosted trees
# or boosted linears. Some parameters are relevant in both cases, but even so we
# would want to model them differently, e.g. `num_iterations` might need to be lower for
# boosting trees than for boosting linear functions.

# First, create a container model (because of space nesting, we need to do this)
# plus its constructor:
